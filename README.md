# Logistic-Regression

In this project, we implement a Logistic Regression model with gradient descent from scratch. Logistic regression is a statistical model used for binary classification. We start with the fundamental mathematics and statistics behind logistic regression, and then extend it to multinomial logistic regression which can handle multi-class classification problems. We test the model on a real dataset to recognize images of hand-written digits.
